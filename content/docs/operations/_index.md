This section provides details about operating Riser. Knowledge of Riser operations is not required for the typical usage of Riser.

Riser is an experimental project that is not yet recommended for production use. This section will be developed as Riser matures. The recommended way to test Riser is to use `riser demo install` against an existing Kubernetes cluster as instructed in the [Quickstart]({{< relref "docs/quickstart" >}}). This configures Riser as well as all operational components such as Knative and Istio.

For the adventurous, the [riser-server repo](https://github.com/riser-platform/riser-server/tree/main/config) contains some base yaml for a Riser development environment that could be used as a basis for building your own installation.
