# Environments

An _Environment_ in Riser represents a
[deployment environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployment_environment).
There is a one-to-one mapping between a Kubernetes cluster and an _Environment_.
Riser has no restrictions on how or what environments you have or  how those environments
are used. An _Environment_ is created when the
[Riser Controller](https://github.com/riser-platform/riser-controller)
is installed to a Kubernetes cluster.
